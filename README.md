# 🚀 Awesome Flutter Test!

## 🏗 Architectural Decisions

The project follows a **mono-repo** structure, where both the features and platform packages are part of the same Flutter package inside the repository. This keeps them decoupled and ready to scale into a multi-repo if needed by simply moving packages.

## 🛠 Melos Integration

With multiple packages in the repo, **Melos** simplifies package management, allowing us to run scripts across all mapped packages without the need for custom shell scripts or manual `flutter pub get` executions.

## 📂 Project Structure

### Features & Platform

- **Features**: Contains the functionalities (currently only `restaurants`).
- **Platform**: Contains utility packages like `dependency_injection`, facilitating developer workflows.

### Modular Architecture

To maintain modularity, each module manages its own dependencies and routes via a shared contract:
- `SF` prefix indicates classes used globally within the project.

## 🧱 Architecture Layers

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles, dividing the codebase into three main layers:

1. **Presentation**: Handles UI, routes, and controllers (presenters). Contains Flutter-specific code.
2. **Domain**: Contains core business logic, including **UseCases**, **Entities**, **Value Objects** like `Name`, and **Repository Contracts**.
3. **Repository**: Responsible for data retrieval, and implementing contracts defined in the domain layer.

## 📦 State Management

The app uses **Cubit** (from `flutter_bloc`) for state management, as recommended by Google. It offers a low learning curve for new developers and integrates well with `bloc_test` for unit testing.

## 🧪 Testing

- **Widgets**: Covered with widget tests.
- **Other layers**: Covered with unit tests.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Using **Maestro** to cover core app functionalities.

## Running

    - dart pub global activate melos
    - flutter pub get
    - export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin" 
    - melos run get
    - flutter run --dart-define=YELP_API_KEY=APIKEY 

## Observations

The request to API are mocked due to a daily limit of requests, but the real repo is also implemented.
